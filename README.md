# Monthly-Traffic-Volume-Analysis

After the 2008 recession, the US economy recovered strongly, but the effects were not experienced equally across this country. The West coast, East coast and urban areas in general have thrived; other regions are still struggling to recover. Post-recession, traffic has grown immensely in the Bay Area as people flock there for work opportunities. These travelers and new residents support the local economy. However, many communities outside tech and commerce centers like the Bay Area have been left behind in the post-recession rise. 

We believe the metric of traffic volume captures the return of activity and life to a region and the lack of recovery in some regions in the US. The slow recovery of traffic outside of commerce and tech centers signifies that these areas have not truly recovered from the Great Recession. Future efforts to stimulate the economy need to be structured to support growth across the nation, not just in tech hubs.

Here, we collate, clean and analyse Monthly traffic volume data obtained from the US Federal Highway Administration. Data was collected from this website https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tables/tmasdata/

Folders : 
1) Datasets : has majority of monthly excel files
2) Datasets_II : has all the files for 2002-03 which donot have the state wise breakup, not used for our analysis
3) Datasets_III : has some of the files with data in a different format from majority

CSV Data : 
1) data_reshaped : has the combined dataset from 2003-2019
2) 18-19 Mileage : combined dataset for 2018 - 2019

Files:
1) Region Wise I : graph highlighting the effect of economic crisis on different regions
2) Region Wise II : graph highlighting the growth post economic crisis in different regions
3) Urban Vs Rural : graph highlighting the changes in rural and urban traffic post Hurricane Katrina
4) EDA_PROJ_KA_SK_v3 : presentation covering our analysis

Codes:
1) Collate_files_I : function to collate all the data from different xls files
2) Graphs : notebook for aggregating data and generating graphs
3) Graphs 2: pdf of notebook for generating rest of the graphs (contributed by [Kamron Afshar](https://github.com/kjafshar))
